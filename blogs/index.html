                <h2> Learn about javascript in funny way</h2>
                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

                <h2> why is Google the best?</h2>
                <p>As a Google partner for more than seven years now, we see firsthand that Google attracts people who are smart and high achievers but are also humble and always looking to improve themselves and the company. That keeps Googlers from becoming complacent -- a path that many tech giants that are more arrogant follow. - Bruno Guicardi, CI&T</p>

                <p>DSA also helps in tasks like data search, which plays an important role in any application. The DSA typically shifts the focus of programming from the syntax to the approach. If you notice, most of the computer science books in any curriculum will have a chapter or a course on DSA.</p>

                <h2>what is C language ? </h2>
                <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems. </p>
